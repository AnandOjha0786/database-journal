This section provides some of the most frequently asked ``database`` interview questions.

Database Management System (DBMS)
=================================

A database management system (DBMS) is software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides its users and programmers with a definite way to create, retrieve, update and manage data in a database.

**What is a Relational Database?**

A relational database is a type of database that uses a structure to identify data, access data and relate it to another data in the database. It contains rows as records and columns as fields to store data in a table structure. Popular relational databases include MySQL, PostgresSQL, MariaDB, etc.


**What is a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL database unlike relational database have no schema or in better words, flexible schema. Data is typically represented in JSON document format and is not adhered to table format. Popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, etc.


**What is a graph database?**

A graph database is a database that uses graph structures for schema representation. It uses nodes, edges, and properties to represent and data store. Popular graph databases include Neo4j, GraphQL, OrientDB, etc.


**What is a time series database?**

Time series database is a purpose built database that is optimized for handling time series data which is essentially data indexed with one of its column being a time stamp. It shows change in data values over time.


**What is a search database?**

A search-engine database is a type of database that is dedicated to the search of data content. Search-engine databases use indexes to categorize the similar characteristics among data and facilitate search capability such as full-text search, complex search expressions, search results rankings.


**What is a ledger database?**

Ledgers database are special-purpose databases that are typically used to record chain of activities or series of  financial transactions of an application. Blockchain frameworks, such as Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, can also be used as a ledger. 


Basics
======

**What is a database?**

Database is a set of data that is stored in a specific format to allow its easy accessibility. Database is a central collection of data that can be accessed through different client softwares. For example, MySQL client allows for accessing and manipulating data from MySQL database.


**What is a database model?**

Database model define how the data is stored, accessed and manipulated. For example, if the data is stored in table format with defined columns, it is referred to as the relational database model.


**What is CRUD in databases?**

CRUD is an acronym for the four basic types of database operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete. Any database application allows for one or more of these basic operations to be performed on the databse.


**What is indexing in a database?**

Index is a data structure and it can be visualized similar to an index in a book. The reader of the book simply looks up the index if he is not sure of which page contains the information he is interested in. On similar lines, database indexing is a way to efficiently perform queries on a database by minimizing the number of disk accesses in the process.


**What is Data Warehousing?**

A data warehouse is storage of data that is collected from various individual data sources which support analytical and structured querying to take some strategic decision. Efficiently using data warehouse to drive critical decisions is called data warehousing. A data warehouse is designed for analytical queries rather than for transactional queries.


Relational DBMS
===============

**What is SQL and what are the characteristics of SQL?**

* SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a used for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database.
* SQL is an ANSI and ISO standard computer language for creating and manipulating databases.
* SQL is very simple and easy to learn.
* A wide variery of databases are compatible with SQL as the query language
* SQL is used to define the data in the database and manipulate it when needed.


**What are the different table relationships in a relational database?**

The 3 Types of Relationships in Database Design:

* One-to-One: A row in one TableA can have only one matching row in TableB, and vice versa

* One-to-Many: TableA can have many matching rows in TableB, but a row in TableB can have only one matching row in TableA

* Many-to-Many: A row in TableA can have many matching rows in TableB, and vice versa


NoSQL DBMS
==========

**What are the characteristics of NoSQL databse?**

* NoSQL database offers schema free reads and writes

* NoSQL databases are easily scalable

* They use distributed computing

* Theyâ€™re able to process unstructured (text blobs) and semi-structured data
